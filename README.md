## House Rent Prediction using Linear Regression
# Overview
This project predicts the monthly house rent based on features like BHK, Size, Bathroom, City, Furnishing Status, and Area Type using Linear Regression.
The dataset undergoes preprocessing, transformation, and feature encoding to build an interpretable and accurate regression model.

# Dataset
File: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset?select=House_Rent_Dataset.csv

Streamlit: https://7-10-25-home-rent.streamlit.app/

# Key Features:
- BHK:Number of bedrooms
- Size:Total area (in sq. ft)
- Bathroom:Number of bathrooms
- City:Location of the property
- Furnishing Status:Furnishing condition (Furnished / Semi-Furnished / Unfurnished)
- Area Type:Built area type (Super Area / Carpet Area / Built Area)
- Rent:Monthly rent (Target variable)

# Data Preprocessing
- Power Transformation (Yeo-Johnson) applied on BHK and Size to stabilize variance and make data more Gaussian.
- Log Transformation applied on Rent and Bathroom to reduce skewness.
- Standard Scaling applied to normalize all numerical features.
- One-Hot Encoding used for categorical variables (City, Furnishing Status, Area Type).
- Dataset split into train (80%) and test (20%) using train_test_split.
  
# Model Development
1. Algorithm Used: LinearRegression from scikit-learn
2. Model trained on transformed and encoded features.
3. Coefficients and intercepts were extracted for interpretability.
4. Evaluation metrics used:RÂ² Score,Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
